## Notes

For the purposes of Backup keep in mind the following intricacies:

- Amazon Glacier and Azure Archive require blob level management and due to thawing/rehydration requirements will likely never be supported in Hyper Backup or similar automatic backup software; that said it is a perfect target for one-way sync of an encrypted backup containers with immutable objects -- such as Duplicacy. 
- Backblaze B2 is not supported by Synologyâ€™s Hyper Backup. Synology [promised B2 support in Hyper Backup in 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/synology/comments/6r29m8/please_help_get_backblaze_b2_supported_as_a/)
- When storage needs approach 2 Tb Crashplan Pro again becomes an option,  however performance are a concern. 

## Conclusions

It seems as of today, Wasabi offers most compatible and cost effective backup target. It can be supplemented with Microsoft LRS Archive tier (some tinkering required) for immutable backup containers. Otherwise Wasabi remains a viable choise for long term storage as well, closely followed by BackBlaze B2.
